						<p class="col-md-10">During my time with Future Sight AR, a subsidiary of XR Solutions Inc, I was lead developer of the Katana XR app.  Katana XR is AR/MR training software aimed primarily at EPC companies, but is applicable for any heavy industry related field.  The Katana XR app takes book shelves of manuals, installation guides, quality checks, and work packages and makes them available digitally when and where you need them.  As the lead developer, I leveraged Unity's crossplatform capability paired and powerful graphical AR/MR functionality to create a cohesive and scalable codebase that could be used to rapidly deploy Katana XR onto any device.  By approaching the project with a crossplatform mentality at the start, I was able to avoid issues with versioning and platform-specific functionality that would have otherwise bogged down development</p>

							<p>I was first tasked with creating Katana XR from scratch for the Magic Leap One.  The biggest hurdle at this stage was working in a fledgling field with little-to-no existing design conventions.  Katana XR's early designs and concepts were nebulous at best, and the abilities of the Magic Leap One itself was a relatively unknown factor as well.  Working closely with the lead designer and project manager, I rapidly prototyped several ideas while testing the platform's capabilities and limitations.  By using rapid prototypes and video capture, I was able to help solidify the design and function of the app in less than a month by providing tangible examples to help hone in on the core function of Katana XR.</p>

							<p>Development on the Magic Leap One gave me valuable experience working with proprietary spatial software and hardware.  I quickly familiarized myself with the basic functionality of the headset and developed my own tests in order to better understand the platform and best practices in order to bring the best experience.  Katana XR officially launched on Magic Leap World on October 15th, 2019 after a fast 6 months of development.  As Lead developer, I am also responsible for implementing updates, new features, and maintaining the store listing for Katana XR.</p>

							<p>Upon completion of the Magic Leap One version, my next goal was to port the current Katana XR app to AR Core and AR Kit capable Android and iOS devices.  By starting from a crossplatform mindset at the get-go, I was able to get a universal mobile version ready for deployment with ease.  By utilizing Unity's new AR Foundation package, I was able to further create an application that was able to build out for Android or iOS with a single click.  Katana XR for Mobile opened for beta testing on Google Play and the App Store on January 25th, 2019.  As Lead Developer, I am currently responsible for maintaining and updating the core codebase, and ensure a uniform experience across Future Sight AR's various platforms.</p>
