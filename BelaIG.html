						<p class="col-md-10">While working as a contractor for Humulo Engineering, I was tasked with creating a web based application for the US Department of Interior.  The goal was to create an interactive game that allowed users to learn about the flora and fauna of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve while presenting an accurate representation of the geographic features in all four seasons.  The target audience was children K-6, with and emphasis on exploration and education.  The project was constructed using Unity WebGL, and was built to be mobile first and as lightweight as possible.</p>

							<p>BELA was always intended to be a tool that engaged users to explore and learn more about the environment and features of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve.  By pairing with the executive team and assessing the requirements of the client, I was able to create concise design briefs and concepts that would help portray the final vision without multiple iterations.  Before the first line of code had been written, I had established the working guidelines, design brief, and interaction flow with both the client and executive team.</p>

							<p>One of the toughest aspects of this project was the amount of content that the client wished to display within one app.  With over 20 species of animal and a baker's dozen plant specimens that needed to be showcased, each was to be displayed in their natural habitat with a corresponding example for all four seasons.  Migration patterns, seasonal adaptations, and physical characteristics each had to be displayed, with descriptive text to help explain the features in depth.  After procuring an acceptable base model for each species, I worked to create seasonal variations of each one, map the correct animations, and program each to follow their own unique herd behaviors.  Each variation was verified by the park rangers and botanists before implementation into the final product.</p>

							<p>The main goal was to keep the app accessible with minimal cost to the client.  Initially, I pursued creating Native Android and iOS versions of the web app, but eventually settled on creating a hybrid web-app experience.  Despite the fact that it would be displayed wildly differing hardware, I was able to create a seamless experience that was uniform across all devices, without the need for the client to purchase developer licenses and maintain store listings that were likely to fall behind.</p>
