						<p class="col-md-10">While working as a freelancer, I took a contract for Round Ed Learning, Inc, producing short animations to use in their educational Unity app.  The project was to be built in Unity, not exported as a video, in order to better incorporate freely into Unity Projects, so some development work was required to make the animations easily consumable.  By utilizing the Unity Timeline and Cinemachine toolsets, I was able to produce simple and effective animations paired with small quizes and client-provided voiceover clips.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-5">
							<p>The client's intent was to create a series of animations to help explain math concepts to K-6 children.  These animations would be paired alongside lessons and games that the child could play, linked to a larger teaching network that allowed educators to track progress.  The animations would need to be built directly into Unity rather than pre-rendered.</p>

							<p>The concepts had to be explained quickly, and strict adherence to the client provided script was required in order to stay synchronized with the voiceover.  Animations typically would run from point to point, allowing the user to skip to specific sections.  By keeping to the mindset of providing users with a quick reference, I helped divide the concepts into easily consumable pieces.</p>

							<p>Some development work was required in order to create these animations in a way that could be easily consumed by other developers.  I built the components with as much drag-and-drop functionality as possible, and provided clear documentation that allowed for additional development to continue with the framework I had created.</p>
