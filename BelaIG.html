						<p class="col-md-10">While working as a contractor for Humulo Engineering, I was tasked with creating a web based application for the US Department of Interior.  The goal was to create an interactive game that allowed users to learn about the flora and fauna of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve while presenting an accurate representation of the geographic features in all four seasons.  The target audience was children K-6, with and emphasis on exploration and education.  The project was constructed using Unity WebGL, and was built to be mobile first and as lightweight as possible.</p>

										<h3></h3>
										<span>After being accepted into the Independent Creator Program, I was tasked with creating Katana XR from scratch for the Magic Leap One.  Katana XR officially launched on Magic Leap World on October 15th, 2019 after a fast 6 months of development.</span>

										<h3>Katana for Android/iOS</h3>
										<span>Immediately following the delivery of the Magic Leap app, my next goal was to port our existing app to mobile platforms.  Sensing this from the start, I had built the original Magic Leap app using Unity, making my transition from MR to AR quicker and easier.</span></span>

										<h3>Katana Web Viewer</h3>
										<span>One of the major aspects of Katana XR was the ability to upload and attach tutorial-specific 3D models via Katana's companion Web App.  The challenge became how to best provide a user with a view and limited editing capability of models they had uploaded.  Thus the Katana Web Viewer component was born, I built the viewer from Unity WebGL and injected into our existing Angular 8 web app.</span>
